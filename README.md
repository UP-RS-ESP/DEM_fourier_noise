# Matlab code for DEM noise analysis using 2D DFT

This MATLAB<sup>TM</sup> function is intended for the spectral analysis of gridded topographic data (DEMs) for analysis of high-frequency, low-wavelength noise as presented in:

# Running it

Prior to analysis the user must download and set path to a few required functions:

1. The 2DSpecTools package from T. Perron available [here](http://web.mit.edu/perron/www/downloads.html)
    * For background on this spectral analysis procedure and the paper that spurred this analysis refer to: Perron, J. T., Kirchner, J. W., and Dietrich, W. E.: Spectral signatures of characteristic spatial scales and nonfractal structure in landscapes, Journal of Geophysical Research, 113, 2008. (https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JF000866)

2. The TopoToolbox package from W. Schwanghart available [here](https://github.com/csdms-contrib/topotoolbox)
