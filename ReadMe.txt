This MATLAB (TM) function is intended for the spectral analysis of gridded topographic data (DEMs) for analysis on high-frequency, low-wavelength noise as presented in:

Purinton, B., and Bookhagen, B.: Validation of digital elevation models (DEMs) and geomorphic metrics on the southern Central Andean Plateau, Earth Surface Dynamics, 2017


Prior to analysis the user must download and set path to a few required functions:

(1) The 2DSpecTools package from T. Perron available at:
			
		http://web.mit.edu/perron/www/downloads.html
		
	For background on this spectral analysis procedure and the paper that spurred this analysis refer to:
